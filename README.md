## Software Engineer | Backend & Distributed Systems | Telnyx

Backend software engineer working on high-throughput messaging systems and distributed microservices.  
My work focuses on Python-based backend services, event-driven architectures, and production reliability.

I care about clear system design, correctness under load, and understanding how systems behave in real production environments.

## Side Projects & Ongoing Work

Creator of **Tributum** (tributum.ro), a frontend-focused platform built for an accounting business, emphasizing clean UI, maintainability, and integration with backend services.

In parallel, I’m actively working on several personal projects, some of which are available in my public repositories:

- A game designed to help remote workers interact and collaborate in a more informal, social setting.
- A custom terminal user interface (TUI) shell written in Rust, with a focus on usability and extensibility. Development updates will be published as the project evolves.
- A programming language project exploring interpreter design, with an emphasis on flexible execution models and potential AI-assisted interpretation.
- Additional backend systems and experiments, with more work planned to be released publicly under **bumbuindustries**.

These projects primarily serve as a space to explore systems design, tooling, and ideas outside of my day-to-day work.

## About

I’m interested in backend platform engineering, messaging infrastructure, and distributed systems.  
I prefer systems that are simple, observable, and resilient rather than overly abstract.
